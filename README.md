# Subscription Tracker

## Project Link

## Technologies Used
- React
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- HTML5
- CSS

## Process
Since a user can have many subscriptions, it's also possible a subscription can be used for many users.
With this many-to-many relationship, the following database schemas are being used:

A User table to hold user information
Column | name
--- | ---
 | string

A 


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to see all of my subscriptions.
- As a user, I want to be able to add/delete/modify subscriptions related to me.
- As a user, I would like to see how much my total spend is with a subscription.
